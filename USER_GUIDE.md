### Work Flow

In development, you mainly put your code inside 2 folders `src` and `views`.

To compile, run:
```
npm run build
```

To bundle and run the app, run:
```
npm start
```

To make the command above run automatically everytime you change your code, run:
```
npm run watch
```

### How it works

First, at the back-end, we use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve the page (and optionally do server-side rendering).

The front-end is handled by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

We use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile later version of Javascript into ES5 to support most browsers.

We also use webpack to merge all the files into a compact package in the `public` folder.

We then make the build automated by using [npm-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-watch). We specified what to be "watched" inside section `watch` in `package.json`.
